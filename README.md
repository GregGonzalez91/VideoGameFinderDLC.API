# VideoGameFinderDLC.API

Video Game Finder is a C# API to help find, sort, and rate a video game library. 

We sought to take some of the video game 'collecting' components of services such as Steam, and build a more user friendly, thinned, version that gives you the freedom to 
find and edit a video game library.  Each game can be detailed with genre, playable game systems, ratings, release date, ESRB rating, personal rating, price, and player count / multiplayer option. 

Our target audience are gamers of any experience level.  

Why did we build this?  All four members of the team are video game lovers and we thought itâ€™d be fun to build something that includes one of our favorite hobbies.


## How it works: 
Video Game Finder API is fully equipped with CRUD that permits user to log in, then create, view, update, or delete a game, a game genre, a game system, and/or a personal user rating.
