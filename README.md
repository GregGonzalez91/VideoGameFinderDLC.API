# VideoGameFinderDLC.API

Video Game Finder is a C# API to help find, sort, and rate a video game library. 

We sought to take some of the video game 'collecting' components of services such as Steam, and build a more user friendly, thinned, version that gives you the freedom to 
find and edit a video game library.  Each game can be detailed with genre, playable game systems, ratings, release date, ESRB rating, personal rating, price, and player count / multiplayer option. 

Our target audience are gamers of any experience level.  

Why did we build this?  All four members of the team are video game lovers and we thought itâ€™d be fun to build something that includes one of our favorite hobbies.

## How it works: 
Video Game Finder API is fully equipped with CRUD that permits user to log in, then create, view, update, or delete a game, a game genre, a game system, and/or a personal user rating. 

IMPORTANT: 
To add data for game, game system, game genre and a unique user rating, you must add data in the following steps: 
1. Game System - If no game system exists, or the game system you want is not yet added, please start with CREATING one.  
2. Game Genre - If no game genre exists, or the gam egenre you want is not yet added, please add this after adding a game system. 
3. Game - GameSystemId and GameGenreId are required to create a game, and these are automatically created once the above steps have been taken. 
4. User Rating - GameId is required to create a user rating, a GameId is created when following the above step. 

WARNINGS: 
1. If you delete a Game Genre or Game System, any games tied to them will not be fully viewable or editable. 
2. If you delete a Game, your saved User Rating will be deleted permanently.
